# Overview
This is a simple JSF (JavaServer Faces) project integrated with PrimeFaces, created as a demonstration for my portfolio. The project showcases a web application built using Jakarta EE technologies and PrimeFaces UI components. It's designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate how JSF and PrimeFaces can be used to build responsive and interactive user interfaces.


## Features
- User-friendly interface with PrimeFaces components
- A simple form for collecting data
- Validation using PrimeFaces and JSF features
- Navigation between pages using JSF
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Real-time data updates using AJAX

## Tech Stack
- **JSF (JavaServer Faces)**: A Java web framework for building user interfaces.
- **PrimeFaces**: A UI component library for JSF that provides rich UI components.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation tool.
- **Java**: Backend logic and processing.
- **SQL**: For database queries.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For frontend layout and interaction.
- **GlassFish**: Jakarta EE application server.
- **MySQL**: Database server.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Apache Maven (for building the project)
- A Jakarta EE-compatible server (e.g., Apache Tomcat, GlassFish)
- MySQL database server

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michaelcherrera84/Portal.git

2. Build the project using Maven:
3. Deploy the WAR file to your application server.
4. Add the test database [ASDVConstruction.sql](ASDV_Construction.sql).

## Usage
The primary purpose of this app is to demonstrate basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a MySQL 
database and basic UI/UX design utilizing JSF/PrimeFaces technologies.

Example:
```markdown
Once the application is running, you can:
1. Navigate to the homepage to see an example of HTML/CSS design and layout.
2. Login to restricted pages (note: This is not a completed login. The current implementation merely tests the 
   ability to connect to the database server using the provided credentials. For example, Username: root and 
   Password: root).  
3. Explore the navigation and how different JSF pages work together.
4. Fill out the forms and submit data to see validation and interaction.
```
